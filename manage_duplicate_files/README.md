This checks the list of completed datasets (i.e. where all the lumis have been processed, e.g. for a set split in 1000, there should be 10000 lumis) and obtains a list of all the existent/published files for each dataset.

Results are stored for each dataset separatelly in `./output/${STEP_NAME}/${dataset_name}.txt`
